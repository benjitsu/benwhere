<p>If you speak to any old asian hand long enough they’ll likely regale you with endless lore of the Bangkok of years past. The stories usually start with Patpong, Soi Cowboy, and heroin addicted soldiers on R&R from the Vietnam war. But, if you dig back even farther in time, the stories usually move onto how Bangkok was once just a wet riverside city sometimes referred to as the Venice of the east.</p>

<p> Legend has it that Bangkok, a city founded in the wet marsh lands on the edge of the Chao Praya river, originally had more canals than roads, with boats being the primary mode of transportation for its residents. Over time the canals were filled in with cement, forming the modern roadways that criss-cross the city. The commuter boats were traded in for buses, taxis, and motorbikes, and the traffic that Bangkok is famous for was born. </p>
